      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> Hello World! I am 23 year old male. I am very eager to learn and try new things.Looking forward to meeting everyone</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in New York city. I moved to Scranton,Pennsylvania when I was young. Yes for those of you that are "The Office" fans, then you have heard of my hometown.The show is based off of my hometown for those of you unsure. Being in your hometown is great and all ,but I need to get out and spread my wings. July 3, 2018 is when i decided "Im going to take a trip to Florida for a vacation". More like an extended vacation.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a very active person, so with that being said pretty much anything outside i will be willing to do</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be completely honest i am unsure of a career path to choice. I know eventually I want to own my own business</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Orlando,Fl </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> Ive always been fond of the behind the scence kind of person. Im a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. When I first moved to Florida I tried to learn python. I was picking up on it but i just wasn't motivated to do it on my own. I had a great conversation with a gentleman, and he made me realize that I can't not keep letting opportunity slip through my fingers. I found out about the coding bootcamp and just could not let this one slip through my finger.
